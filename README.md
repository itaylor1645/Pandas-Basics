# Pandas Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains a focused pandas practice project using a synthetic people dataset.  
The goal of the project is to refresh and reinforce core data manipulation skills in a clean,
interview-ready workflow.

## What This Project Covers

- Loading and inspecting tabular data
- Filtering and sorting rows
- GroupBy aggregations and frequency analysis
- Feature engineering (derived columns, binning)
- String parsing and text analysis
- Writing clear, idiomatic pandas code
- Chaining operations for readability and correctness

## Dataset

The dataset is a synthetic CSV containing basic demographic and company information
(e.g. name, age, gender, city, company, email).  
It is used purely for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes

This project was built as a deliberate refresher and practice exercise to ensure
strong fundamentals before applying pandas to larger analytics or modeling workflows.

The notebook is intended to run cleanly from top to bottom without hidden state.
